              <li>You will not be entitled for a refund if you do not take any action on your order within 30 days of placing it. If you want to reactivate your design order, you must pay a fee that varies depending on the project.</li>
              <li>After the final files have been given, no refund requests will be considered.</li>
              <li>If a customer is satisfied with the project but requests a refund due to a change of mind or other personal concerns throughout the project, the client is not eligible for a refund.</li>

              <li>A strong reason for a refund request must be offered, which must be reviewed against the design brief and customer input for adjustments. A refund will not be offered unless the concept is not developed in accordance with the brief; nonetheless, more modifications will be provided until complete satisfaction is reached.</li>
              <li>Money back guarantee is based on that the order is placed in good faith. Where a customer has placed design orders with more than one design agency for the same job to claim a refund, we do not consider it in good faith. In such a case we reserve the right to decline a refund request.</li>
              <li>All design jobs require customer feedback before finalizing the design therefore it is only fair that the customer gets involved and provides feedback to get the desired results.</li>
              <li>100% unique design guarantee entitles you to a re-draw if our designed logo is to be found considerably similar to another logo design that may already exist. Any resemblance to an existing design will be merely a coincidence and The Techfel will not accept any responsibility or claim of any compensation in such a case. It is the client's responsibility to get their artwork copyrighted.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Note: Techfel hold all the rights to reject any project or cancel the contract whenever it seems necessary. After the refund, you will not have any rights to use the designs for any purpose; they will be the sole property of The techfel. The company will be the rightful owner of the designs.</p>
